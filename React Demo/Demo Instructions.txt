STEPS.

*Download both folders 'WebsiteForDemo' and 'addskills3001'*

1.) Open Command Prompt/Terminal depending on if you're using Windows or Mac.
2.) Navigate into the 'WebsiteForDemo' folder.
3.) Type "npm start". The main website should now be running on your localhost:3000.
4.) Open another instance of Command Prompt/Terminal.
5.) Navigate into the 'addskills3001' folder.
6.) Type "npm start". The 'add skills' component should now be running on your localhost:3001.

In your browser you can navigate to the localhost:3000 tab and run the demo! (You can close the tab that is running localhost:3001, that will be used later in the demo, anyway.)
