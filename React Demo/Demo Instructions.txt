Type all commands without quotations.

STEPS.

1.) Open Command Prompt/Terminal depending on if you're using Windows or Mac.
2.) Navigate to the directory that has 'WebsiteForDemo' folder in it.
3.) In either Command Prompt/Terminal, type "npm start WebsiteForDemo". The main website should now be running on your localhost:3000.
4.) Open another instance of Command Prompt/Terminal.
5.) Navigate to the directory that has 'addskills3001' folder in it.
6.) In either Command Prompt/Terminal, type "npm start addskills3001". The 'add skills' component should now be running on your localhost:3001.

In your browser you can navigate to the localhost:3000 tab and run the demo! (You can close the tab that is running localhost:3001, that will be used later in the demo, anyway.)
